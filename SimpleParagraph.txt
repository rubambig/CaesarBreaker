                          Reel Injun Movie Screening
    The movie screening  highlighted the changes in the narration regarding
Native Americans in the cinematic industry of America throughout the twentieth
century.Some of the themes discussed in the movie were: Nobel Injun,Savage
Injun, The Cowboy, and a Good Injun is a Dead Injun.Nobel Injun entailed the
capturing of the disappearance of Native American tribes through a silent film
in the 1920s.An ironic moment of the film was the suicide of a Native American
actor before his real identity of being tri-racial was about to revealed.
Savage Injun was reinforced in movies such as Stagecoach by portraying Native
peoples as savages when America was in the midst of the Great Depression.The
Cowboy theme was embodied in John Wayne’s movies portraying the “real meaning”
of being an American.The Good Injun is a dead Injun portrayal put Native peoples
on the defensive whereby their self-concept as human beings was being preceded
by their fight to not lose their Native identity.
